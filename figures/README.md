# `figures`

This directory contains all figures used in the manuscript, including the 
main text artistic figures. The raw output from running the Python scripts 
in `code/` is stored in the `plots/` subdirectory of `main_text` and `supplement_text`
if further processing in Adobe Illustrator was required.
