  An Optimal Regulation of Fluxes Dictates Microbial Growth In and Out of Steady-State
authors: >
  Griffin Chure and Jonas Cremer
Abstract: >
  Effective coordination of cellular processes is critical to ensure the
  competitive growth of microbial organisms. Pivotal to this coordination is the
  appropriate partitioning of cellular resources between protein synthesis via
  translation and the metabolism needed to sustain it. Here, we present a
  coarse-grained and organism-agnostic theory of microbial growth centered on the
  dynamic regulation of this resource partitioning. At the core of this regulation
  is an optimization of metabolic and translational fluxes, mechanistically
  achieved via the perception of charged- and uncharged-tRNA turnover. An
  extensive comparison with ≈ 50 data sets from Escherichia coli establishes the
  theory’s veracity and shows that it can predict a remarkably wide range of
  growth phenomena in and out of steady-state with quantitative accuracy. This
  predictive power, achieved with only a few biological parameters, cements the
  preeminent importance of protein synthesis in microbial growth and establishes
  the theory as an ideal physiological framework to interrogate the dynamics of
  growth, competition, and adaptation in complex and ever-changing environments.
