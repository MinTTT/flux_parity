  A Mechanistic View of Protein Synthesis and Its Regulation PredictsMicrobial
  Growth In and Out of Steady State

Abstract: >
  Effective coordination of cellular processes is critical to ensure the
  competitive growth of microbial organisms. Pivotal to this coordination is the
  appropriate partitioning of cellular resources between protein synthesis and
  the metabolism needed to sustain it. Here, we present a coarse-grained and
  organism-agnostic model of microbial growth centered on the dynamic regulation
  of resource partitioning. At the core of this regulation is the perception of
  charged- and uncharged-tRNA turnover via a global regulator which ensures
  optimal partitioning and thus efficient growth. An extensive comparison with
  50 data sets from <i>Escherichia coli</i> establishes the model and shows
  that it can predict a remarkable wide range of growth phenomena in and out of
  steady-state with quantitative accuracy. This strong predictive power,
  achieved with a common set of only a few biological parameters, demonstrates
  that protein synthesis is the arbiter of microbial growth and makes the model
  an ideal physiological framework to interrogate the dynamics of microbial
  growth, competition, and adaptation in ever-changing environments.

  This is a website dedicated to our upcoming publication on the fundamentals 
  of protein-mediated growth. This page will be updated and changed dramatically
  as the paper is developed.
