\section{Introduction}
\begin{enumerate}
\item While understanding the regulation of bacterial growth has been the subject 
of extensive research for over the past century, recent years have seen a surge 
of quantitative studies exploring how the macromolecular composition of the cell 
is defined at molecular resolution. 
\item The culmination from this body of work is the formulation of "bacterial growth laws" 
which are simple, effective representations of the economic strategies underlying 
the regulation of gene expression and the allocation of cellular resources to 
maximize growth rate. 
\item These growth laws have been studied extensively, and many works have derived 
(and re-derived) them using a number of different strategies, assumptions, and notation.
\item THis results in a body of work which
